# CSS-selectors
Create a new HTML document with the title "Selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS"
Create a new CSS file and import it into the main HTML document
 Create a button with the text "Move over" (TIP: You must add this text through a pseudo-element)
 Use pseudo-classes so that when you hover over this button, the text turns white and the background turns green.
 Use the pseudo-elements to change the button text to "Done!"
